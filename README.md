# Leffell High Altitude Balloon Main Arduino Code

This project is in the process of being assembled. Code from other components can be found elsewhere in the [Leffell-Space](https://github.com/orgs/Leffell-Space/repositories) organization, and we are adding code from those separate repositories to this one. This will be the final code that gets launched.

## Features

- Collects GPS, temperature, pressure, and ozone telemetry data
- Tracks balloon location using GPS
- Records high-quality flight footage with Insta360 camera
- Logs all sensor data to SD card for post-flight analysis
- Activates buzzer upon landing for recovery assistance

- Arduino Mega needs to be used as Arduino UNO does not have enough storage space
- Data is logged to an SD card with the following column headers: Time, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, HDOP, Inside Temperature, Outside Temperature, Pressure, Ozone Concentration

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Leffell-Space/Arduino_Main_Weather_Balloon.git
   ```
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE
3. Install the necessary libraries through the Arduino Library Manager or manually:
   - SD (built-in)
   - SPI (built-in)
   - Wire (built-in)
   - OneWire
   - DallasTemperature
   - TinyGPSPlus
   - MS5611 (from https://github.com/gronat/MS5611.git)
   - DFRobot_OzoneSensor (from https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_OzoneSensor.git)
4. **Configure your build options:**  
   Copy the `config.h.example` file to `config.h` in the same directory. Edit `config.h` to enable or disable features (such as sensors and debug output) by changing the values from `1` (enabled) to `0` (disabled) as needed for your hardware setup.
   ```bash
   cp src/config.h.example src/config.h
   ```
5. Upload the code to your Arduino Mega board

## Data Collection and Error Handling

The system includes several production-ready features to ensure data integrity:

- **Temperature Validation**: Sensor readings are validated against a reasonable range (-90°C to 60°C). Invalid readings are marked with -999.0 in the data file.
- **SD Card Resilience**: The system tracks SD card availability and automatically attempts to reconnect every 60 seconds if the card becomes unavailable.
- **GPS Validation**: The buzzer for landing detection only activates when valid GPS altitude data is available.
- **Data Logging**: All sensor data is logged to the SD card with timestamps in the format: `Time,Lat,Long,Alt,HDOP,Inside Temp,Outside Temp,Pressure,Ozone`
